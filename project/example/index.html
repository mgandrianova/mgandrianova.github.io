      <p>Special studies have shown the high effectiveness of basketball for the all-round development of the child&rsquo;s body. Running and jumping activate the growth of the body in length. Throws to a high target contribute to the formation of correct posture, passing the ball over a long distance, fighting for the ball at the backboard develop muscle strength. Under the influence of physical activity that children receive in classes and competitions, the activity of the cardiovascular system improves, chest circumference and lung capacity increase.
Exercises of special physical training, due to the conjugated effect, contribute to the development of coordination of speed, speed-strength qualities, dexterity and orientation, thereby creating the prerequisites for mastering and improving the technique and tactics of the game.</p>
<p>Relevance: In modern life, more and more use of physical exercises is aimed not at achieving high results, but at increasing their health-improving effect on a person. To solve such a global problem, the most effective means are, first of all, sports games.</p>
<p>Modern basketball is in a stage of rapid creative upsurge, aimed at intensifying actions, both in attack and in defense. It is one of the means of physical development and education of young people. In accordance with the comprehensive program of physical education for schoolchildren, basketball is one of the means of physical education.</p>
<p>Purpose: to form ideas about the history of basketball and its varieties.</p>
<p>In the course of planning the work being carried out, the author of the project put forward the following hypothesis: suppose that a variety of types of basketball and the actual game activity have unique properties for the formation of vital skills and abilities, therefore, it is an effective means of improving health.</p>
<p>What is basketball?
Basketball is a sports team game with a ball in which the ball is thrown with the hands into the basket (ring) of the opponent.</p>
<p>Basketball is played by two teams. Usually a team consists of 12 people, 5 of which are field players, and the rest are considered substitutes.</p>
<p>Basketball Rules
Athletes in possession of the ball must move around the field, hitting the floor with it. Otherwise, &ldquo;carrying the ball&rdquo; will be counted, and this is a violation of the rules in basketball. Accidentally touching the ball with a body part other than the hand is not considered a foul, unlike purposeful play with the foot or fist.</p>
<p>A basketball game consists of 4 periods or halves, but the timing of each half (play time) varies depending on the basketball association. There are short breaks between periods. The ball thrown into the basket can bring a different number of points to its team. If the ball is scored during the free throw, the team earns 1 point. If the ball is thrown from an average or close distance (closer than the 3-point line), then the team is given 2 points.
A team earns three points if the ball is scored from behind the three-point line. If in regular time both teams scored the same number of points, then a 5-minute overtime is assigned, if it ended in a draw, then the next one is assigned and so on until the winner is determined. The player is only allowed to take two steps with the ball, after which he must either shoot or pass.</p>
<p>Types of basketball.</p>
<p>Mini basketball. Mini-basketball rules were developed in the early 1950s by American Jay Archer. The game is intended for children aged 6-12 and is divided into two levels: mini-basketball itself (age group 9-12) and micro-basketball (for children under 9).</p>
<p>Mini-basketball is played by teams of five players each, although &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; teams are also allowed - up to 2x2. Often there are matches between mixed teams (which include both boys and girls). The game is played in four halves of 6 minutes. The rules of the game are somewhat different from classic basketball. In mini-basketball, for example, net time is not fixed and the “three-second rule” does not apply.</p>
<p>Wheelchair basketball. Appeared in 1946 in the USA. Former basketball players, who during the Second World War received serious injuries and injuries on the battlefields, did not want to part with their favorite game and came up with &ldquo;their&rdquo; basketball. Now it is played in more than 80 countries. The number of officially registered players is 25 thousand people.
The International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF) holds various sports events: World Championship - every 4 years; annual tournaments of club teams, zonal competitions (once or twice a year), etc. Wheelchair basketball has been included in the program of the Paralympic Games since the first such Olympics were held in Rome in 1960. Wheelchair basketball rules have their own prohibitions and restrictions. For example, &ldquo;jogging&rdquo; is prohibited - when a player, in the process of dribbling the ball, spins the wheel with his hand more than two times.</p>
<p>Streetball (from the English &ldquo;street&rdquo; - street). A more dynamic and aggressive sport than classic basketball. The game involves two teams of three players each (sometimes with one spare) on a special streetball court or on a regular basketball court, using only one half of it - and, accordingly, only one ring. In case of a miss, the team that attacked the ring before, protects it from the attack of the opponent, etc. Which team will start the game is determined by lot.</p>
<p>The game goes on until one of the teams scores 16 points (but the gap in the score must be at least 2 points). Sometimes they play up to a gap of 8 points or for a time (20 minutes) - in this case, the 30-second rule applies: if during this time the team has not managed to complete the attack, the ball goes to the opponent. For a successful throw, a team is awarded a point, for a throw from a 3-point zone - two points.</p>
<p>A goal scored in the basket is counted only if it has been touched by two players of the attacking team. The ball then goes to the defending team: play resumes as soon as one of its players has touched the ball. In this case, the ball must first be taken out of the 3-point line. Jogging, double dribbling and throwing into the basket from above are prohibited.</p>
<p>Korfball (from Dutch korf - basket). This game was invented in 1902 by a schoolteacher from Amsterdam, Nico Brekhuysen. Two teams of 8 people each (4 men and 4 women) play on a 40x20m court divided in half by the middle line, two halves of 30 minutes. Four players (2 men and 2 women) are in their own half of the court and defend their basket, four are in the half of the opposing team, their task is to hit the &ldquo;alien&rdquo; ring.</p>
<p>After two successful shots, the defenders move into the offensive zone and vice versa. Korfball is a less contact game than basketball. At the same time, according to the rules, a man can only play against a man, and a woman against a woman. Dribbling in korfball is not allowed, and the player who has possession of the ball can take no more than two steps with it. The ring is narrower in diameter than a basketball one (40 cm), and it is attached higher (3.5 m). (There is a more “large-scale” version of the game: with a larger area, the number of players, etc.)</p>
<p>The process of playing basketball is saturated with a large number of special techniques that require technical and tactical skills, and the emerging spirit of rivalry provides a storm of interest for the participants in the match. During the game, a person needs to use different muscle groups for complex maneuvering movements, running and high jumps, which ensures the all-round development of the athlete. The dynamic process of the game forces the players to use their powers wisely, constantly changing their level of activity.
Practice your favorite sport!
