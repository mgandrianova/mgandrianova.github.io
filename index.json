Running and jumping activate the growth of the body in length. Throws to a high target contribute to the formation of correct posture, passing the ball over a long distance, fighting for the ball at the backboard develop muscle strength. Under the influence of physical activity that children receive in classes and competitions, the activity of the cardiovascular system improves, chest circumference and lung capacity increase. Exercises of special physical training, due to the conjugated effect, contribute to the development of coordination of speed, speed-strength qualities, dexterity and orientation, thereby creating the prerequisites for mastering and improving the technique and tactics of the game.\nRelevance: In modern life, more and more use of physical exercises is aimed not at achieving high results, but at increasing their health-improving effect on a person. To solve such a global problem, the most effective means are, first of all, sports games.\nModern basketball is in a stage of rapid creative upsurge, aimed at intensifying actions, both in attack and in defense. It is one of the means of physical development and education of young people. In accordance with the comprehensive program of physical education for schoolchildren, basketball is one of the means of physical education.\nPurpose: to form ideas about the history of basketball and its varieties.\nIn the course of planning the work being carried out, the author of the project put forward the following hypothesis: suppose that a variety of types of basketball and the actual game activity have unique properties for the formation of vital skills and abilities, therefore, it is an effective means of improving health.\nWhat is basketball? Basketball is a sports team game with a ball in which the ball is thrown with the hands into the basket (ring) of the opponent.\nBasketball is played by two teams. Usually a team consists of 12 people, 5 of which are field players, and the rest are considered substitutes.\nBasketball Rules Athletes in possession of the ball must move around the field, hitting the floor with it. Otherwise, “carrying the ball” will be counted, and this is a violation of the rules in basketball. Accidentally touching the ball with a body part other than the hand is not considered a foul, unlike purposeful play with the foot or fist.\nA basketball game consists of 4 periods or halves, but the timing of each half (play time) varies depending on the basketball association. There are short breaks between periods. The ball thrown into the basket can bring a different number of points to its team. If the ball is scored during the free throw, the team earns 1 point. If the ball is thrown from an average or close distance (closer than the 3-point line), then the team is given 2 points. A team earns three points if the ball is scored from behind the three-point line. If in regular time both teams scored the same number of points, then a 5-minute overtime is assigned, if it ended in a draw, then the next one is assigned and so on until the winner is determined. The player is only allowed to take two steps with the ball, after which he must either shoot or pass.\nTypes of basketball.\nMini basketball. Mini-basketball rules were developed in the early 1950s by American Jay Archer. The game is intended for children aged 6-12 and is divided into two levels: mini-basketball itself (age group 9-12) and micro-basketball (for children under 9).\nMini-basketball is played by teams of five players each, although “reduced” teams are also allowed - up to 2x2. Often there are matches between mixed teams (which include both boys and girls). The game is played in four halves of 6 minutes. The rules of the game are somewhat different from classic basketball. In mini-basketball, for example, net time is not fixed and the “three-second rule” does not apply.\nWheelchair basketball. Appeared in 1946 in the USA. Former basketball players, who during the Second World War received serious injuries and injuries on the battlefields, did not want to part with their favorite game and came up with “their” basketball. Now it is played in more than 80 countries. The number of officially registered players is 25 thousand people. The International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF) holds various sports events: World Championship - every 4 years; annual tournaments of club teams, zonal competitions (once or twice a year), etc. Wheelchair basketball has been included in the program of the Paralympic Games since the first such Olympics were held in Rome in 1960. Wheelchair basketball rules have their own prohibitions and restrictions. For example, “jogging” is prohibited - when a player, in the process of dribbling the ball, spins the wheel with his hand more than two times.\nStreetball (from the English “street” - street). A more dynamic and aggressive sport than …","date":1653696000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653696000,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://example.com/project/example/","publishdate":"2022-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"Basketball.","tags":["Sports"],"title":"Project on the topic \"Basketball, its types and their history\"","type":"project"},{"authors":["Andrianova Marina"],"categories":"-Demo","content":"What is a programming language? A programming language is a formal language for writing computer programs. A programming language defines a set of lexical, syntactic and semantic rules that determine the appearance of the program and the actions that the performer (usually a computer) will perform under its control.\nSince the creation of the first programmable machines, mankind has come up with more than eight thousand programming languages ​​(including esoteric, visual and toy ones). Every year their number increases. Some languages ​​are used only by a small number of their own developers, others become known to millions of people. Professional programmers can be proficient in several programming languages.\nA programming language is intended for writing computer programs, which are a set of rules that allow a computer to perform a particular computational process, organize control of various objects, etc. A programming language differs from natural languages ​​in that it is designed to control a computer, while how natural languages ​​are used primarily for communication between people. Most programming languages ​​use special constructs to define and manipulate data structures and control the process of computation.\nScientific programming languages Scientific programming is a highly oriented style of programming for scientific computing. It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, and the predominance of efficiency over universality. Scientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies - from quantum computers to space programs - would not be possible without scientific programmers who can provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.\nScientists use various programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of problem and the preferences of the author. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran; many debugged libraries of mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations are written on it, which is relevant for economics and biology, respectively.\nPython has a simpler syntax, which is also suitable for programming mathematical calculations. The Python language is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and can work with some other “scientific” languages: Fortran, C++, C#.\nIn turn, C# allows you to program on the .NET platform, adapt the program to the common language runtime (CLR), and accelerate development within the framework of operational scientific sessions.\n","date":1653696000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590624000,"objectID":"e4fdade84aa6444de7f600d536eec609","permalink":"https://example.com/post/getting-started/post-8/","publishdate":"2022-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/post-8/","section":"post","summary":"Programming languages.","tags":["blog"],"title":"Scientific programming languages.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Andrianova Marina"],"categories":"-Demo","content":"Last week This week I went to face-to-face classes of English, mathematical logic (there was a control), mathematical analysis (there was also a control).

Markdown (pronounced markdown) is a lightweight markup language designed to indicate formatting in plain text while maintaining human readability as much as possible, and suitable for machine conversion into advanced publishing languages ​​(HTML, Rich Text, and others).\nStory Originally created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz. Many language ideas have been borrowed from existing text markup conventions in emails. Markdown language implementations convert Markdown text to valid, well-formed XHTML and replace left angle brackets (\u0026#34;\u0026lt;\u0026#34;) and ampersands (\u0026#34;\u0026amp;\u0026#34;) with the appropriate entity codes. The first implementation of Markdown was Gruber’s Perl implementation, but after a while, many third-party implementations appeared. The Perl implementation is distributed under a BSD type license.
